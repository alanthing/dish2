# Dish

Dish is a command line tool for interaction with the DHIS 2 Web API. It aims at simplifying common tasks and is suitable for handling batch metadata operations, system maintenance operations and more.

### Installation

Dish is a NPM [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dish2) and requires *nodejs* and *NPM* to be installed on your local system. You can install Dish with:

<pre>npm install dish2 -g</pre>

The "-g" global option will ensure that you can invoke the available Dish commands anywhere on your command line.

### Configuration

Dish is configured through a *dish.json* configuration file which must be a valid JSON object. Note that the protocol (e.g. http://) is mandatory for the base URL. Example configuration:

<pre>
{
  "dhis": {
    "baseurl": "http://localhost:8080",
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "district"
  }
}
</pre>

This configuration file will be searched for at a location defined by a *DHIS2_HOME* environment variable (borrowed from the DHIS 2 setup). If not found, your home directory will be searched. Place the *dish.json* file in the desired directory.

<pre>
export DHIS2_HOME='/home/dhis/config'
touch /home/dhis/config/dish.json
</pre>
